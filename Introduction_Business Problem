Identifying the business problem:
Toronto is the largest city in Canada with an estimated population of around 6 million, so it is a good place for entrepeneurs eager to open new businesses that become profitable
and get a good number of customers to do so. 
The goal of this project is to use Foursquare API to provide the location data and clustering of venues information to find out what would be the best neighborhoods in the area
of Central Toronto to open a new gym venue. Nowadays people are going to gyms more frequently due to the increasing interest for a healthy lifestyle.

Target audience:
this project is aimed to entrepreneurs or business owners who want to open a new gym or grow their current business in a profitable location where little or no gyms already exist.
